# MC4D

This repository contains the 4D whole-cell model for the genetically minimal cell, JCVI-syn3A. Below, you will find instructions on required programs that need to be installed, instructions on how to run the model, and descriptions of individual simulation files.

## Required Programs

- [Lattice Microbes](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/Lattice_Microbes) - [https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/Lattice_Microbes](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/Lattice_Microbes)
- [odecell](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/odecell) - [https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/odecell](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/odecell) (Install this in the same conda environment as Lattice Microbes AFTER building Lattice Microbes)
- [btree_chromo](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/btree_chromo_gpu) - [https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/btree_chromo_gpu](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/btree_chromo_gpu) (Requires installation with Kokkos enabled version of LAMMPS)
- [sc_chain_generation](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/sc_chain_generation) - [https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/sc_chain_generation](https://github.com/Luthey-Schulten-Lab/sc_chain_generation)
- [FreeDTS](https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/FreeDTS) - [https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/FreeDTS](https://github.com/weria-pezeshkian/FreeDTS) (OPTIONAL)

## Running the Model

The model here is runnbale as-is and does not reuire its own installation. Once you have installed the required programs listed above, before running the model, you must activate the conda environment in which you built Lattice Microbes:

```
conda activate envName
```

Then, you must make sure that your LAMMPS installation for ```btree_chromo``` is in your path. You can check this by running:

```
lammps -h
```

Once your environment is ready, you can now run the model.

The python file ```Whole_Cell_Minimal_Cell.py``` is the main executable for the model. The executable has the following user input variables:

|  Variable  | Shorthand | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| --outputDir | -od | Name of directory that will be created to store trajectory files. DO NOT INCLUDE A '.' |
| --simTime | -t | Amount of biological time to be simulated in units of seconds. |
| --cudeDevices | -cd | Integer index of the GPU to use for the Lattice Microbes RDME solver. |
| --dnaSoftwareDirectory | -dsd | Directory containing the ```btree_chromo/``` and ```sc_chain_generation/``` directories. |
| --dnaRngSeed | -drs | Integer RNG seed that will be used for the chromosome programs. |
| --workingDirectory | -wd | Directory where the simulation is being run in. Defaults to current directory, no input is needed. Only necessary to change on clusters. |

Example executable:

```
python Whole_Cell_Minimal_Cell.py -od replicate1 -t 1200 -cd 1 -drs 13 -dsd /home/zane/Software/
```

## Restarting a simulation

If you want to run more time for a simulation or you need to restart a simulations because of a crash, you can run the available restart python script ```Restart_Whole_Cell_Minimal_Cell.py```

This python executable has the same input variables as the original script. This will only run if ```outputDir``` is a directory that contains all associated files with a previously run simulation from the main script. For example, if you provided the input ```-od replicate1``` previously, giving that same argument to the restart script will take the simulation state from the replicate1 directory.

The ```simTime``` variable is how much more biological time you want to run. If you have simulated 3600 seconds and want to reach a total of 6000 seconds, you would give an input of 2400 for this variable.
